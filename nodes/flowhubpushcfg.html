   <p>Push current flow tab to FlowHub.org.<br>
      FlowHub nodes are ignored when flow-tabs are pushed to FlowHub.<br>
      Flow tabs are exported as they <b>are in the editor</b>. What you see<br>
      is what you export, the deployed flow might differ. This allows flows to<br>
      be modified <b>without</b> having to be deployed.
    </p>
    
   <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
      FlowHubPush is the twin to the FlowHubPull node and is responsible for<br>
      uploading the current flow tab to FlowHub. The Flow tab ID is used as<br>
      identifier. The current flow tab in which the FlowHubPush node is<br>
      located will be uploaded.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
      FlowHubPush can be dragged into the flow, the button can be pressed to<br>
      push the flow to FlowHub. Although for the button to be active, the<br>
      flow has to be deployed at least once.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
      Documentation on the flow should be included in the info box of the<br>
      flow. Double click on the flow tab opens the property window and<br>
      that's the documentation that will be hosted at FlowHub. Please provide<br>
      documentation otherwise or a flow that is so simple to understand<br>
      that it requires no documentation!
  </p>

  <p>
      Submission can either be done using an API token or using an email<br>
      and full name. See the property tab for details on the usage of this<br>
      service.
