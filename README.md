## FlowHub: Gist for Node-RED

**Work In Progress**

These are the Node-RED nodes that interact with [flowhub.org](flowhub.org).

[FlowHub.org](https://FlowHub.org) is a first attempt to provide a gist-like service for Node-RED.

The aim is to make it easy to share flow-tabs amongst Node-RED developers.

Flows can be exported directly from the Node-RED editor to FlowHub.org. Flows that have been edited but not deployed can be exported. Flows are taken from the editor not the Node-RED server.

Flows can be imported into the Node-RED editor using the pull node. Flows can be imported into new tabs or directly into existing tabs.

## Node: FlowHub - Pull

Node for importing flows from FlowHub.org. Flows may be imported into an existing tab or a new tab.

## Node: FlowHub - Push

Node for pushing in-editor flows to FlowHub.org. Flows do not need to be deployed to be exported.

By exporting any flows you accept the license as described below.

The entire flow-tab is exported to FlowHub.org, so beware what you export.

## License

All flows found here are licensed under the [don't do evil license](https://cdn.openmindmap.org/LICENSE.txt).

**Usage of FlowHub.org implies an adherence to that license.**.
